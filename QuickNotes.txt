Timer:
-Going to use TIMER2 for PWM
-I believe that TIMER2, TIMER3, TIMER4, TIMER5 can all be used for pwm
-Going to use PA0 and PA1 pins for pwm. These pins correlate with TIM2_CH1 and TIM2_CH2 i their alternate function modes.
-TIM2 can handle both servos because CH1 and CH2 can be controlled independently aka set a different duty cycle on each of the channels.
-Each servo' position can be update independently by changing only CCR1 or CCR2 regs.

GPIO:
-GPIO port B will be used for the external push buttons. Becase TIM2_CH1 and TIM2_CH2 is on port A (Just feel like it)
-I will need to use 4 pins for the external push buttons.
-I will use PB4, PB5, PB14, PB15
-PB4 will be for panning left. PB5 will be for panning right. PB14 will be for tilting down. PB15 will be for tilting up.
-These pins will be made input of course

Switches:
-I think I'm going to use a
